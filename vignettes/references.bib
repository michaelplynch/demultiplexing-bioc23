	abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises from the renal cortex or the renal tubular epithelial cells. It is classified into clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC, accounting for about 85\% of all the primary renal cancers. The other 15\% constitutes of transitional cell carcinoma, Wilms tumor or nephroblastoma, tumors of the collecting ducts, and renal sarcomas. They are heterogeneous diseases with different biology, genetics, and behavior. Overall, the incidence has been steadily increasing, and currently, it is the 7th most common cancer among men. Among the genitourinary cancers, RCC has the highest mortality rate. The increase in incidence could be attributed to incidental diagnosis. About 60\% of the cases are detected incidentally.},

	abstract = {Although immunotherapy research to date has focused largely on T cells, there is mounting evidence that tumour-infiltrating B cells and plasma cells (collectively referred to as tumour-infiltrating B lymphocytes (TIL-Bs)) have a crucial, synergistic role in tumour control. In many cancers, TIL-Bs have demonstrated strong predictive and prognostic significance in the context of both standard treatments and immune checkpoint blockade, offering the prospect of new therapeutic opportunities that leverage their unique immunological properties. Drawing insights from autoimmunity, we review the molecular phenotypes, architectural contexts, antigen specificities, effector mechanisms and regulatory pathways relevant to TIL-Bs in human cancer. Although the field is young, the emerging picture is that TIL-Bs promote antitumour immunity through their unique mode of antigen presentation to T cells; their role in assembling and perpetuating immunologically ‘hot’ tumour microenvironments involving T cells, myeloid cells and natural killer cells; and their potential to combat immune editing and tumour heterogeneity through the easing of self-tolerance mechanisms. We end by discussing the most promising approaches to enhance TIL-B responses in concert with other immune cell subsets to extend the reach, potency and durability of cancer immunotherapy.},

Cytotoxic T cells expressing cell-surface CD8 are the most powerful effectors in the anticancer immune response and form the backbone of current successful cancer immunotherapies. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors are designed to target immune-inhibitory receptors that function to regulate the immune response, whereas adoptive cell-transfer therapies use CD8+ T cells with genetically modified receptors—chimaeric antigen receptors—to specify and enhance CD8+ T-cell functionality. New generations of cytotoxic T cells with genetically modified or synthetic receptors are being developed and evaluated in clinical trials. Furthermore, combinatory regimens might optimise treatment effects and reduce adverse events. This review summarises advances in research on the most prominent immune effectors in cancer and cancer immunotherapy, cytotoxic T cells, and discusses possible implications for future cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a special subtype of dendritic cells with the morphology of plasma cells. pDCs produce massive amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I), which was originally found to play an extremely pivotal role in antiviral immunity. Interestingly, accumulated evidence indicates that pDCs can also play an important role in tumorigenesis. In the human body, most of the IFN-α is secreted by activated pDCs mediated by toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. In many types of cancer, tumors are infiltrated by a large number of pDCs, however, these pDCs exhibit no response to TLR stimulation, and reduced or absent IFN-α production. In addition, tumor-infiltrating pDCs promote recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) into the tumor microenvironment, leading to immunosuppression and promoting tumor growth. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the development of pDCs and their roles in a variety of malignancies, with special emphasis on the basic mechanisms.},

The former typically exerts anti-tumor functions, including directly mediate cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to kill tumor cells; the latter can promote the occurrence and metastasis of tumor cells, inhibit T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response, promote tumor angiogenesis, and lead to tumor progression. Both M1 and M2 macrophages have high degree of plasticity and thus can be converted into each other upon tumor microenvironment changes or therapeutic interventions. As the relationship between TAMs and malignant tumors becoming clearer, TAMs have become a promising target for developing new cancer treatment.

We therefore developed MULTI-seq: multiplexing using lipid-tagged indices for single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. MULTI-seq reagents can barcode any cell type or nucleus from any species with an accessible plasma membrane. The method involves minimal sample processing, thereby preserving cell viability and endogenous gene expression patterns. MULTI-seq enables doublet identification, which improves data quality and increases cell throughput by minimizing the negative consequences of Poisson droplet loading. MULTI-seq sample classifications additionally identify cells with low RNA content that would otherwise be discarded by standard quality-control workflows. We use MULTI-seq to track the dynamics of T-cell activation, perform a 96-plex perturbation experiment with primary human mammary epithelial cells, and multiplex cryopreserved tumors and metastatic sites isolated from a patient-derived xenograft mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.},

	abstract = {High-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies hold tremendous potential for defining cell types in an unbiased fashion using gene expression and epigenomic state. A key challenge in realizing this potential is integrating single-cell datasets from multiple protocols, biological contexts, and data modalities into a joint definition of cellular identity. We previously developed an approach, called linked inference of genomic experimental relationships (LIGER), that uses integrative nonnegative matrix factorization to address this challenge. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for using LIGER to jointly define cell types from multiple single-cell datasets. The main stages of the protocol are data preprocessing and normalization, joint factorization, quantile normalization and joint clustering, and visualization. We describe how to jointly define cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data, but similar steps apply across a wide range of other settings and data types, including cross-species analysis, single-nucleus DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics. Our protocol contains examples of expected results, describes common pitfalls, and relies only on our freely available, open-source R implementation of LIGER. We also provide R Markdown tutorials showing the outputs from each individual code segment. The analysis process can be performed in 1–4 h, depending on dataset size, and assumes no specialized bioinformatics training.},

Here, we compared second-generation (BBζ and 28ζ) with third-generation (28BBζ) carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-targeted CAR constructs and investigated the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells with different CD4/CD8 proportions in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that BBζ exhibited superior efficacy compared with 28ζ and 28BBζ CAR-T cells in a clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) skrc-59 cell bearing NSG-SGM3 mouse model. The mice treated with a single dose of BBζ CD4/CD8 mixture (CAR4/8) showed complete tumor remission and remained tumor-free 72 days after CAR-T cells infusion. In the other CAR-T and control groups, tumor-infiltrating T cells were recovered and profiled. We found that BBζ CAR8 cells upregulated expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and cytotoxicity-associated genes, while downregulating inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor genes and diminishing differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), leading to excellent therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Increased memory phenotype, elevated tumor infiltration, and decreased exhaustion genes were observed in the CD4/8 untransduced T (UNT) cells compared with CD8 alone, indicating that CD4/8 would be the favored cellular composition for CAR-T cell therapy with long-term persistence. In summary, these findings support that BBζ CAR4/8 cells are a highly potent, clinically translatable cell therapy for ccRCC.},

While numerous clinical studies are still ongoing for hematological malignancies, research is developing to translate the feasibility of CAR T therapy in solid organ malignancies. Unfortunately, the majority of diagnosed cancers are primarily solid tumors. Thus, a highly unmet clinical need for further research and development exists in this field. This review article highlights currently active clinical trials and a few pertinent preclinical studies involving CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors while briefly discussing study outcomes and potential key targets that may allow for the feasibility of this therapy option. Finally, we mention critical challenges existing in the solid tumor environment and discuss developing strategies that may potentially overcome the existing barriers to CAR T cell progress in solid tumors.},

	abstract = {Multimodal single-cell profiling methods that measure protein expression with oligo-conjugated antibodies hold promise for comprehensive dissection of cellular heterogeneity, yet the resulting protein counts have substantial technical noise that can mask biological variations. Here we integrate experiments and computational analyses to reveal two major noise sources and develop a method called “dsb” (denoised and scaled by background) to normalize and denoise droplet-based protein expression data. We discover that protein-specific noise originates from unbound antibodies encapsulated during droplet generation; this noise can thus be accurately estimated and corrected by utilizing protein levels in empty droplets. We also find that isotype control antibodies and the background protein population average in each cell exhibit significant correlations across single cells, we thus use their shared variance to correct for cell-to-cell technical noise in each cell. We validate these findings by analyzing the performance of dsb in eight independent datasets spanning multiple technologies, including CITE-seq, ASAP-seq, and TEA-seq. Compared to existing normalization methods, our approach improves downstream analyses by better unmasking biologically meaningful cell populations. Our method is available as an open-source R package that interfaces easily with existing single cell software platforms such as Seurat, Bioconductor, and Scanpy and can be accessed at “dsb [https://cran.r-project.org/package=dsb]”.},

At the same time, rapid growth has forced continuous reevaluation of the underlying statistical models, experimental aims, and sheer volumes of data processing that are handled by these computational tools. Here, I review key computational steps of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, examine assumptions made by different approaches, and highlight successes, remaining ambiguities, and limitations that are important to keep in mind as scRNA-seq becomes a mainstream technique for studying biology.},

MULTI-seq reagents can barcode any cell type or nucleus from any species with an accessible plasma membrane. The method involves minimal sample processing, thereby preserving cell viability and endogenous gene expression patterns. When cells are classified into sample groups using MULTI-seq barcode abundances, data quality is improved through doublet identification and recovery of cells with low RNA content that would otherwise be discarded by standard quality-control workflows. We use MULTI-seq to track the dynamics of T-cell activation, perform a 96-plex perturbation experiment with primary human mammary epithelial cells and multiplex cryopreserved tumors and metastatic sites isolated from a patient-derived xenograft mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.},

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNA-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

This problem probably has many causes, including an underappreciation of the danger of being misled by off-target effects when using pharmacological or genetic perturbants in complex biological assays. This danger is particularly acute when, as is often the case in cancer pharmacology, the biological phenotype being measured is a 'down' readout (such as decreased proliferation, decreased viability or decreased tumour growth) that could simply reflect a nonspecific loss of cellular fitness. These problems are compounded by multiple hypothesis testing, such as when candidate targets emerge from high-throughput screens that interrogate multiple targets in parallel, and by a publication and promotion system that preferentially rewards positive findings.

Here we generate reference T cell atlases for cancer and viral infection by multi-study integration, and develop ProjecTILs, an algorithm for reference atlas projection. In contrast to other methods, ProjecTILs allows not only accurate embedding of new scRNA-seq data into a reference without altering its structure, but also characterizing previously unknown cell states that “deviate” from the reference. ProjecTILs accurately predicts the effects of cell perturbations and identifies gene programs that are altered in different conditions and tissues. A meta-analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from several cohorts reveals a strong conservation of T cell subtypes between human and mouse, providing a consistent basis to describe T cell heterogeneity across studies, diseases, and species.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Existing demultiplexing strategies rely on availability of complete genotype data from the pooled samples, which limits the applicability of such methods, in particular when genetic variation is not the primary object of study. To address this, we here present Vireo, a computationally efficient Bayesian model to demultiplex single-cell data from pooled experimental designs. Uniquely, our model can be applied in settings when only partial or no genotype information is available. Using pools based on synthetic mixtures and results on real data, we demonstrate the robustness of Vireo and illustrate the utility of multiplexed experimental designs for common expression analyses.},

Multiplexing across donors is a popular experimental design that can avoid batch effects, reduce costs and improve doublet detection. By using variants detected in scRNA-seq reads, it is possible to assign cells to their donor of origin and identify cross-genotype doublets that may have highly similar transcriptional profiles, precluding detection by transcriptional profile. More subtle cross-genotype variant contamination can be used to estimate the amount of ambient RNA. Ambient RNA is caused by cell lysis before droplet partitioning and is an important confounder of scRNA-seq analysis. Here we develop souporcell, a method to cluster cells using the genetic variants detected within the scRNA-seq reads. We show that it achieves high accuracy on genotype clustering, doublet detection and ambient RNA estimation, as demonstrated across a range of challenging scenarios.},

These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of {\textgreater}99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates.

Dr. Eric Chow gives an overview of single cell sequencing, explains why this approach is useful, and talks through the leading methods.

Single cell sequencing, as the name implies, allows researchers to examine the genomic information for individual cells. This provides an opportunity to examine cell-to-cell differences and identify cell subtypes, which provides insight into how specific cells function within and respond to their environment. Dr. Eric Chow begins his talk with an overview of single cell sequencing with a focus on RNA. He then goes on to outline the predominant approaches, including plate-based, microfluidic-based, and combinatorial indexing methods. He finishes by addressing approaches to single cell analysis that don’t rely on RNA, including methods that use DNA, proteins, and antibodies. He also reviews some of the benefits and limitations of analysis at the level of individual cells.

            Atherosclerosis is driven by multifaceted contributions of the immune system within the circulation and at vascular focal sites. Yet the specific immune dysregulations within the atherosclerotic lesions that lead to clinical cerebro- and cardiovascular complications (i.e. ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction) are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell mass cytometry with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) we found that atherosclerotic plaques were enriched in activated, differentiated, and exhausted subsets of T cells vs. blood. Next, using single-cell proteomic, transcriptomic, and cell-to-cell interaction analyses we found unique functional dysregulations of both T cells and macrophages in plaques of patients with clinically symptomatic (SYM; recent stroke of TIA) or asymptomatic (ASYM, no recent stroke) carotid artery disease. SYM plaques were enriched with a distinct CD4
            +
            T cell subset, and T cells were activated, differentiated and presented subset specific exhaustion. SYM macrophages presented alternatively activated phenotypes including subsets associated with plaque vulnerability. In ASYM plaques, T cells and macrophages were activated and displayed a strong IL-1β signaling across cell types, that was absent in SYM plaques. The identification of plaque-specific innate and adaptive immune dysregulations associated with cerebrovascular events provides the basis for the design of precisely tailored cardiovascular immunotherapies.},

Biases, artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization.
Results: We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development.
Availability and Implementation: The open-source code, along with installation instructions, vignettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater .

Genomic and transcriptomic methods have traditionally profiled these intricate ecosystems as bulk samples, thereby masking individual cellular programs and the variability among them. Recent advances in single-cell profiling have paved the way for studying tumors at the resolution of individual cells, providing a compelling strategy to bridge gaps in our understanding of human tumors. Here, we review methodologies for single-cell expression profiling of tumors and the initial studies deploying them in clinical contexts. We highlight how these studies uncover new biology and provide insights into drug resistance, stem cell programs, metastasis, and tumor classifications. We also discuss areas of technology development in single-cell genomics that provide new tools to address key questions in cancer biology. These emerging studies and technologies have the potential to revolutionize our understanding and management of human malignancies.},

We present SpaOTsc, a method relying on structured optimal transport to recover spatial properties of scRNA-seq data by utilizing spatial measurements of a relatively small number of genes. A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell–cell communications are then obtained by “optimally transporting” signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene–gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell–cell communications. SpaOTsc has broader applications, both in integrating non-spatial single-cell measurements with spatial data, and directly in spatial single-cell transcriptomics data to reconstruct spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.},

The purpose of our study was to enrich spatially resolved CODEX® data with gene expression data obtained from CITE-seq experiments performed on the same tissues.

MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.},

	abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancer, and it is the major cause of kidney cancer death. Understanding tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) is critical in cancer immunotherapies. Here, we studied the immune characterization at single-cell resolution by integrating public data of ccRCC across different tissue types, and comparing the transcriptome features and tumor TME differences in tumors, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood. A total of 16 different types of cell components of ccRCC were identified. We revealed that there is an overall increase in T-cell and myeloid populations in tumor-infiltrated immune cells compared to normal renal tissue, and the B-cell population in the tumor showed a sharp decrease, which indicates that the cells in tumor tissue undergo strong immune stress. In addition, the cell–cell communication analysis revealed specific or conserved signals in different tissue types, which may aid to uncover the distinct immune response. By combining and analyzing publicly available ccRCC bulk RNA-seq datasets, 10 genes were identified as marker genes in specific cell types, which were significantly associated with poor prognosis. Of note, UBE2C, which may be a good indicator of tumor proliferation, is positively associated with reductions in overall survival and highly associated with tumor grade. Our integrated analysis provides single-cell transcriptomic profiling of ccRCC and their TME, and it unmasked new correlations between gene expression, survival outcomes, and immune cell-type components, enabling us to dissect the dynamic variables in the tumor development process. This resource provides deeper insight into the transcriptome features and immune response of ccRCC and will be helpful in kidney cancer immunotherapy.},

Specific genes were identified for the most aggressive ccRCC subtype associated with metastasis and a subtype associated with a more favorable course of the disease. Among them were genes associated with blood clotting (FGA, FGG) and genes associated with changes in the immune characteristics of a tumor (ENAM, IGFBP1, IL6). In addition, an association of hub genes of poor survival ccRCC subtype with the levels of infiltration of endothelial cells, hematopoietic stem cells, T cells NK and mast cells was revealed. It was shown that MFI2, CP, FGA, and FGG expression can predict the response to sunitinib, while the APOB, ENAM, IGFBP1, and MFI2 expression predict the response to nivolumab. The results obtained provide insight into the genetic characteristics underlying the aggressive subtype of ccRCC and may help develop new approaches to the treatment of this disease.},

The findings indicated the presence of a pro-metastatic B cell type which could be further classified into 3 subpopulations, MARCH3, B2M and DTWD1, based on their large-scaled genetic profiles, rather than traditional Immature/Mature ones. Although all of the 3 subpopulations appeared to contribute to distant metastasis, B cell (B2M) was deemed to be the most essential. Moreover, STX16, CLASRP, ATIC, ACIN1 and SEMA4B, were genes found to be commonly up-regulated in the 3 subpopulations and this was correlated to a poor prognosis of ccRCC. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of plasma cells in ccRCC was also found to contribute to metastasis of the disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phase II NIVOREN GETUG-AFU 26 study reported safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (m-ccRCC) in a 'real-world setting'. We conducted a translational-research program to determine whether specific circulating immune-cell populations and/or soluble factors at baseline were predictive of clinical outcomes in patients with m-ccRCC treated with nivolumab within the NIVOREN study.
METHODS: Absolute numbers of 106 circulating immune-cell populations were prospectively analyzed in patients treated at a single institution within the NIVOREN trial with available fresh-whole-blood, using dry formulation panels for multicolor flow cytometry. In addition, a panel of 14 predefined soluble factors was quantified for each baseline plasma sample using the Meso-Scale-Discovery immunoassay. The remaining patients with available plasma sample were used as a validation cohort for the soluble factor quantification analysis. Tumor immune microenvironment characterization of all patients included in the translational program of the study was available. The association of blood and tissue-based biomarkers, with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and response was analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 44 patients, baseline unswitched memory B cells (NSwM B cells) were enriched in responders (p=0.006) and associated with improved OS (HR=0.08, p=0.002) and PFS (HR=0.54, p=0.048). Responders were enriched in circulating T follicular helper (Tfh) (p=0.027) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) (p=0.043). Circulating NSwM B cells positively correlated with Tfh (r=0.70, p{\textless}0.001). Circulating NSwM B cells correlated positively with TLS and CD20 +B cells at the tumor center (r=0.59, p=0.044, and r=0.52, p=0.033) and inversely correlated with BCA-1/CXCL13 and BAFF (r=-0.55 and r=-0.42, p{\textless}0.001). Tfh cells also inversely correlated with BCA-1/CXCL13 (r=-0.61, p{\textless}0.001). IL-6, BCA-1/CXCL13 and BAFF significantly associated with worse OS in the discovery (n=40) and validation cohorts (n=313).
CONCLUSION: We report the first fresh blood immune-monitoring of patients with m-ccRCC treated with nivolumab. Baseline blood concentration of NSwM B cells was associated to response, PFS and OS in patients with m-ccRCC treated with nivolumab. BCA-1/CXCL13 and BAFF, inversely correlated to NSwM B cells, were both associated with worse OS in discovery and validation cohorts. Our data confirms a role for B cell subsets in the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with m-ccRCC. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

An integrated, multidimensional, multiregional approach dissecting ITH of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor microenvironment (TME) is employed at the single-cell level with mass cytometry (CyTOF), multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and at the bulk level with whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, and methylation profiling. Multiregional analyses reveal unexpected conservation of immune composition within each individual patient, with profound differences among patients, presenting patient-specific tumor immune microenvironment signatures despite underlying genetic heterogeneity from clonal evolution. Spatial proteogenomic TME analysis using MxIF identifies 14 distinct cellular neighborhoods and, conversely, demonstrated architectural heterogeneity among different tumor regions. Tumor-expressed cytokines are identified as key determinants of the TME and correlate with clinical outcome. Overall, this work signifies that spatial ITH occurs in ccRCC, which may drive clinical heterogeneity and warrants further interrogation to improve patient outcomes.},

To investigate the intratumoral heterogeneity of ccRCC, we analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing data and identified 15 major cell types, along with 39 subgroups of cells derived from tumor or non-malignant tissues, and confirmed their presence by immunofluorescence staining in tissue chips. In this study, we verified that T cell exhaustion was the key factor responsible for the immunosuppressive property of ccRCC tissues, which was significantly related to poor prognosis. We also found that abnormal metabolic patterns occurred not only in cancer cells, but also in tumor-infiltrating stromal cells. Based on the fraction of each cell cluster detected by CIBERSORTx, 533 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) KIRC dataset were divided into three groups. One group, which showed a lesser proportion of activated CD8+ cells and greater proportion of exhausted CD8+ cells, was associated with a poor prognosis. Hence, the blockade of immunosuppressive checkpoints, not only PD-1, but also LAG3, TIM-3, and other inhibitory checkpoints, could serve as a potential target for ccRCC immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Currently, no effective prognostic model of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) based on immune cell infiltration has been developed. Recent studies have identified 6 immune groups (IS) in 33 solid tumors. We aimed to characterize the expression pattern of IS in ccRCC and evaluate the potential in predicting patient prognosis. The clinical information, immune subgroup, somatic mutation, copy number variation, and methylation score of patients with TCGA ccRCC cohort were downloaded from UCSC Xena for further analysis. The most dominant IS in ccRCC was the inflammatory subgroup (immune C3) (86.5\%), regardless of different pathological stages, pathological grades, and genders. In the C3 subgroup, stage IV (69.1\%) and grade 4 (69.9\%) were the least presented. Survival analysis showed that the IS could effectively predict the overall survival (OS) (P {\textless} .0001) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P {\textless} .0001) of ccRCC alone, of which group C3 (OS, HR = 2.3, P {\textless} .001; DSS, HR = 2.84, P {\textless} .001) exhibited the best prognosis. Among the most frequently mutated ccRCC genes, only VHL and PBRM1 were found to be common in the C3 group. The homologous recombination deficiency score was also lower. High heterogeneity was observed in immune cells and immunoregulatory genes of IS. Notably, CD4+ memory resting T cells were highly infiltrating, regulatory T cells (Treg) showed low infiltration, and most immunoregulatory genes (such as CX3CL1, IFNA2, TLR4, SELP, HMGB1, and TNFRSF14) were highly expressed in the C3 subgroup than in other subgroups. Enrichment analysis showed that adipogenesis, apical junction, hypoxia, IL2 STAT5 signaling, TGF-beta signaling, and UV response DN were activated, whereas E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and MYC targets V2 were downregulated in the C3 group. Immune classification can more accurately classify ccRCC patients and predict OS and DSS. Thus, IS-based classification may be a valuable tool that enables individualized treatment of patients with ccRCC.},

Delineating the cells of origin for different RCC subtypes will provide mechanistic insights into their diverse pathobiology. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to develop benign and malignant renal cell atlases. Using a random forest model trained on this cell atlas, we predicted the putative cell of origin for more than 10 RCC subtypes. scRNA-seq also revealed several attributes of the tumor microenvironment in the most common subtype of kidney cancer, clear cell RCC (ccRCC). We elucidated an active role for tumor epithelia in promoting immune cell infiltration, potentially explaining why ccRCC responds to immune checkpoint inhibitors, despite having a low neoantigen burden. In addition, we characterized an association between high endothelial cell types and lack of response to immunotherapy in ccRCC. Taken together, these single-cell analyses of benign kidney and RCC provide insight into the putative cell of origin for RCC subtypes and highlight the important role of the tumor microenvironment in influencing ccRCC biology and response to therapy.},

To continue, we describe the influence of different tumor microenvironment factors such as hypoxia on B cells functions and differentiation. Finally, the role of B cells in response to therapy and as potential target is examined. In accordance with the importance of B cells in immuno-oncology, we conclude that more studies are required to throw light on the precise role of B cells in the tumor microenvironment in order to have a better understanding of their functions, and to design new strategies that efficiently target these cells by immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia is a common hallmark of healthy tissues in physiological states or chronically inflamed tissues in pathological states. Mammalian cells sense and adapt to hypoxia mainly through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Many studies have shown that hypoxia and HIF signaling play an important regulatory role in development and function of innate immune cells and T cells, but their role in B cell biology is still controversial. B cells experience a complex life cycle (including hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, pre-B cells, immature B cells, mature naïve B cells, activated B cells, plasma cells, and memory B cells), and the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the corresponding developmental niche of stage-specific B cells is highly dynamic, which suggests that hypoxia and HIF signaling may play an indispensable role in B cell biology. Based on the fact that hypoxia niches exist in the B cell life cycle, this review focuses on recent discoveries about how hypoxia and HIF signaling regulate the development, metabolism, and function of B cells, to facilitate a deep understanding of the role of hypoxia in B cell-mediated adaptive immunity and to provide novel strategies for vaccine adjuvant research and the treatment of immunity-related or infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {T cell exhaustion is an obstacle to immunotherapy for solid tumors. An understanding of the mechanism by which T cells develop this phenotype in solid tumors is needed. Here, hypoxia, a feature of the tumor microenvironment, causes T cell exhaustion (TExh) by inducing a mitochondrial defect. Upon exposure to hypoxia, activated T cells with a TExh phenotype are characterized by mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased ATP production, and decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity. The TExh phenotype is correlated with the downregulation of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and upregulation of miR-24. Overexpression of miR-24 alters the transcription of many metabolism-related genes including its target genes MYC and fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11). Downregulation of MYC and FGF11 induces TExh differentiation, reduced ATP production and a loss of the mitochondrial mass in T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated T cells. In addition, we determined that MYC regulates the transcription of FGF11 and MFN1. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues, the T cells exhibit an increased frequency of exhaustion and loss of mitochondrial mass. In addition, inhibition of miR-24 signaling decreases NPC xenograft growth in nude mice. Our findings reveal a mechanism for T cell exhaustion in the tumor environment and provide potential strategies that target mitochondrial metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Sample multiplexing is often used to reduce cost and limit batch effects in single-cell RNA (scRNA-seq) sequencing experiments. A commonly used multiplexing technique involves tagging cells prior to pooling with a hashtag oligo (HTO) that can be sequenced along with the cells’ RNA to determine their sample of origin. Several tools have been developed to demultiplex HTO sequencing data and assign cells to samples. In this study, we critically assess the performance of seven HTO demultiplexing tools: hashedDrops, HTODemux, GMM-Demux, demuxmix, deMULTIplex, BFF and HashSolo. The comparison uses data sets where each sample has also been demultiplexed using genetic variants from the RNA, enabling comparison of HTO demultiplexing techniques against complementary data from the genetic “ground truth”. We find that all methods perform similarly where HTO labelling is of high quality, but methods that assume a bimodal counts distribution perform poorly on lower quality data. We also provide heuristic approaches for assessing the quality of HTO counts in a scRNA-seq experiment.},

The co-stimulatory molecule CD27 is a marker of highly suppressive Tregs, although the role of the CD27-CD70 receptor-ligand interaction in Tregs is not clear. Here we show that after prolonged in vitro stimulation, a significant proportion of human Tregs gain stable CD70 expression while losing CD27. The expression of CD70 in expanded Tregs is associated with a profound loss of regulatory function and an unusual ability to provide CD70-directed co-stimulation to TCR-activated conventional T cells. Genetic deletion of CD70 or its blockade prevents Tregs from delivering this co-stimulatory signal, thus maintaining their regulatory activity. High resolution targeted single-cell RNA sequencing of human peripheral blood confirms the presence of CD27−CD70+ Treg cells. These findings have important implications for Treg-based clinical studies where cells are expanded over extended periods in order to achieve sufficient treatment doses.},

It is absent on resting lymphocytes but can be induced in vitro with activating stimuli. To extend information about its expression by different T-cell subpopulations, and its regulation in normal and pathologic conditions, highly purified T-cell subpopulations were studied: CD70 expression depended both on the activating stimulus and on the T-cell subset analyzed. PMA + Ionomycin induced CD70 on the large majority of CD8+ cells, but only on a minority of CD4+ cells (P {\textless} 0.002), and among these, preferentially on the CD45R0+ subset compared with the CD45RA+. The presence of CD4+ lymphocytes in cell cultures containing mixtures of T-cell subsets inhibited CD70 expression on CD8+ cells. On the contrary, stimulation with allogeneic cells induced CD70 expression also on CD4+ cells. Moreover, CD70 was found to be expressed by chronically in vivo activated T-cells, in conditions characterized by allogeneic and autoimmune reactions. These data suggest a possible role of CD70 in the pathogenesis of immune dysregulation; interestingly, this role may not be simply restricted to bind to, and signal through, CD27, since cross-linking of CD70 enhances the proliferative response induced by the stimuli used to elicit its expression.},

	abstract = {The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a hypoxia regulated gene that has a variety of tumorigenic functions. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC), hypoxic signaling is constitutively active because of the frequent loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein. We therefore sought to assess the expression of MIF in CCRC and its biological functions. We stained tumor tissue microarrays comprising sections of 128 CCRC tumors and found MIF to be moderately or highly expressed in {\textgreater}98\%. MIF expression was further found to be dramatically elevated in blood plasma of individuals with CCRC compared with healthy controls, suggesting that measurement of MIF levels in the blood may have utility as a diagnostic marker in CCRC. At a functional level, MIF has been reported to engage the CD74 and CD44 receptors and induce signal transduction. In CCRC cell lines, depletion of MIF, CD74 or CD44 by small hairpin RNA led to a significant reduction in growth rate, and clonogenic survival, coinciding with the degree of knockdown. Interruption of the MIF pathway also decreased tumorigenic potential. Biochemically, we found that in CCRC cells MIF signaling leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to Src phosphorylation, which is critical for regulation of p27. Together, our studies establish MIF as a protumorigenic signaling molecule that functions in an autocrine fashion to promote renal cell carcinoma and may be useful as a minimally invasive marker of disease status.},

Corroborating the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10, deficiency in IL-10 leads to a stimulation of inflammatory responses and inflammatory bowel disease. The anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 fostered the assumption that IL-10 undermines the immune response to cancer. However, mice and humans deficient in IL-10 signaling develop tumors spontaneously and at high rates. Overexpression of IL-10 in models of human cancer or treatment with a pegylated IL-10 (PEG-IL-10) led to tumor rejection and long-lasting tumor immunity. IL-10 stimulates cytotoxicity of CD8(+) T cells and the expression of IFN-γ in CD8(+) T cells. IL-10-induced tumor rejections are dependent on the expression of IFN-γ and granzymes in tumor-resident CD8(+) T cells and the upregulation of MHC molecules. These findings reconcile earlier clinical data, which showed that recombinant IL-10 increased IFN-γ and granzymes in the blood of treated individuals. PEG-IL-10 is therefore a unique therapeutic agent, which simultaneously stimulates antitumor immunity and inhibits tumor-associated inflammation.},

Tumor growth elicits antigen-specific cytotoxic as well as immune suppressive responses. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key immune-suppressive cytokine produced by regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and by helper T-cells (TH). Here we review pleiotropic functions of IL-10 that impact the immune pathology of cancer.

Recent findings
The role of IL-10 in cancer has become less certain with knowledge of its immune stimulatory functions. IL-10 is needed for T-helper cell functions, T-cell immune surveillance, and suppression of cancer-associated inflammation. By promoting tumor specific immune surveillance and hindering pathogenic inflammation IL-10 is emerging as a key cytokine in the battle of the host against cancer.

Summary
IL-10 functions at the cross roads of immune stimulation and immune suppression in cancer. Immunological mechanisms of action of IL-10 can be ultimately exploited to develop novel and effective cancer therapies.},
