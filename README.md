# Demultiplexing scRNAseq workshop/demuxSNP package demo

This page serves as a WIP site for bioc23 demuliplexing/demuxSNP workshop.

The plan is to generate 3/4/ vignettes

1. Intro to demultiplexing. 
Go through some toy example as a 'this is what the data looks like' an introduce how some issues with poor data quality may present themselves.

2. Cell hashing.
Introduce algorithms and do some simulated benchmarking

3. SNPs (maybe) this will be a little trickier as algorithms as much more computaitonally expensive and generally not run native in R. We'll see.

4. demuxSNP package demo, adapted from demuxSNP vignette
